# This week, we will be covering machine learning models (primarily classifiers).

Topics to be covered:

- Bayesian Classification (Sections 2.1 and 2.2)

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- Decision Trees (Information Theory-based) (Sections 5.1 to 5.3)

Some foundational concepts can be revised from:

- Univariate Statistics

- Density Estimation (must cover Sections 1.5 to 1.7)

Additionally, I encourage you to explore a few more models on your own, such as:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier(Optional)

I do not expect you to read the entire text I shared. You may cover the relevant topics from any resource you prefer.

The scikit-learn documentation is a really good source for understanding implementations.

StatQuest videos are great for intuitive understanding. The CodeBasics channel also has some good YouTube videos.

### I would also like you to review some evaluation metrics.


# This week’s task will be given more time (more than a week).




Assignment will be shared soon...
